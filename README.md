# Customer-Segmentation

## Objectives :
In this project introduces clustering algorithm, specifically K Means Clustering, and how we can apply it in a business context to assist customer segmentation.
Some key takeaways:
 1) prepare data for clustering analysis: data transformation and exploratory data analysis
 2) K Neans clustering algorithm implementation using scikit learn
 3) clustering algorithm evaluation using inertia and silhouette score
